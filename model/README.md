# Pokemon Interpolator Model

This directory contains all of the code and data required to train and export the Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). It includes a notebook for scraping image sprites and a notebook for creating the model. Both the trained Keras CAE model and the TensorFlow.js formatted decoder (used by the frontend) are available in the export directory.
